"Only when you take pedophilia out of the context all together does it become possible to talk of a gift. Here are a few examples: “You are so good with children!” “Jack is always so at ease with you” “I am very glad you spoke with her. She is really doing much better.” “Look at him! He’s cheered up now that you’re here.” “She doesn’t sit on anyone’s lap, only on yours.” These are real life quotes spoken to pedophiles. These talents can only be mentioned as long as we do not link these talents to a pedophile. However these talents by pedophiles have enriched many a school and association. I am telling you: these talents do exists."-@Pedofiel_tweets
